a specialist is sought after rather than shopped on price a specialist is much more respected than a jack of all traits
a specialist is paid handsomely to solve a specific problem for their target market 
so figure out the thing your market wants the solution to something that they will pay you handsomely for 
then enter the conversation they're having in their mind preferably something they go to bed worrying about and wake up thinking about
do this and your result will dramatically will improve

trying to target everyone in reality means you are targeting no one

by going too broad, you kill your specializes and become a commodity bough on price
by narrowly defining a target market that you can wow and deliver huge results for,
you become a specialist

  
“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”

One of the ways to do market research is to analyze what your target market is actually buying or is looking for, or look at trading things in Amazon or Facebook marketplace, and find out what people are searching online,

lastly, see what is trending on social media or news sites,
