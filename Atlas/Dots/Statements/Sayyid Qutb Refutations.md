The brother, The Shaykh, Doctor Aboo Mu'aadh 'Abdullah ibn Zayd Al-Muslim Narrated to me from the people of 'Unayzah from the Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Uthaymeen, may Allaah have mercy upon him; that he said concerning Sayyd Qutb: 'Were it not for caution we would have said that he was a disbeliever.'

I say: Shaykh Muhammad, may Allaah have mercy upon him, did not speak out of nothing. For Sayyid Qutb, within his speech, has that which transcends that which is known by neccessity to be prohibited
within the religion. If you will, then say that he fell into that wich is a nullifier from the nullifiers of the Al-Emaan;  insolence towards the Propgets of Allah; towards Mossa and Adam. He spoke [[Wahdatul-Wujood]] and he spoke with the beliefs of the [[Jabbariyah]]. This is known from the reports of his books of Tafseer called: 'in the Shade of the Qur'aan'; and it is, in reality not 'in the shade of the Qur'ann'. i call it, with no objection: 'in the Shade of the Shaytaan' the Qur'aan is free of it, take it from me and do not feel reserved from speaking with it (i.e. the like of my statment).

[[shaykh Ubayd al-Jabiree]] I say: Sayyid Qutb is the imaam of the [[Qutbees]], and the Qutbees are one branch of the [[Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen]], concernin which the secret president of thier organization [['Alee 'Ashmaawee]] said 'A Jamaa'ah has not come out expect for the Jamaa'ah of the [[Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen]]


Shaykh Utheymeen ka thene se nese nuk do ishte per kujdesin ne do ta bejshim ate qafir  ai said qutubi thote se allahu eshte nje me krijset edhe se allahu eshte gjithandej kjo eshte e ditur prej librave te tij te tefsirit e quajtur nen hijen a quranit por ne tevertet nuk eshte nen hijen e quranit shaykh ubejt al jabiri thot une e quej pa kundërshtimi nen hijen e shejtanit qurani eshte i lire nga cka thot ai.

sheykhu thot said qutubi eshte imami i qutbive dhe qutbit jane jne dege e ikwani muslimeen
