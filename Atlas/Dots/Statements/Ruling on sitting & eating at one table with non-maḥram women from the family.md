Question is it allowed for this group of people that consists of brothers their daughters sons and cousins. Men and women, all sitting at one dinner, 

Question is shortened

Answer
[[Shaykh 'Abdul-Aziz 'Abdillah Ibn Baz]]: This is an evil Habit, it is obligatory to abandon it. It is not allowed for a man to sit with a woman that isn't [[mahram]] for him, such as his cousins. It is obligatory that the women sit separately at another table, and that the men sit separately. 

As for a man sitting (at one table) together with his wife, his mother and his aunts, then there is no problem in that.
