How to be Remarkable when you are selling a commodity 
how do you charge high prices for your products and services and have costumers thank you for it
in short by being remarkable when given this answer the first
many business owners do is mutter under their breath something like 
easier said then done, 
perhaps It's because being remarkable evokes visions of unattainably unique or creative something that others far more talented do, dude I just sell coffee how am I Supposed to be remarkable that raises a common question how can you
be remarkable when you sell a commodity lets look at a few examples,

how can our cafe owner be different
one example is with coffee art how much did it cost the cafe to serve
art with its coffee pretty close to zero I would expect made some extra 
training for the barista and extra seconds per cup, but how many people will each costumer tell or better still bring into show could this cafe owner charger 50 cents more per cup than the cafe down the road for sure that's 50 cents of profit multiplied by hundreds of thousands of cups per year, yet is the product unique
not by a long shot just slightly different, different enough to be remarkable.

Here's another example, most e-commerce sites send the same boring confirmation email when you buy from them something among the lines of
your order has been shipped please let us know if it doesn't arrive, thank you.

Instead, take a look at how CD baby creates their email confirmation email

Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.

Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved “Bon Voyage!” to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, Friday, June 6th.

I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did. Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year.” We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

This order confirmation email has been forwarded thousands of times 
and posted on countless blogs and websites and created thousands of new costumers, then again nothing about the product but the transformation of something ordinary and boring gives the costumer a smile and creates free viral marketing for the business,

one more example from another highly competitive commodity industry
costumer electronics when apple first launched the legendary music player the iPod they could have talked about the 5GB storage capacity or technical features like all the other music players of the day did but instead how did they promote it 
one thousand songs in your pocket five GB dost mean a thing to most consumers neither does a bunch of technical jargon, but one thousand songs in your pocket anyone can understand that and the benefits it will offer apple was by no means the first probable music player on the market or even the best, but they were by far the most successful because of their ability to quickly and easily convey the reasons 

why you should buy notice in all three of the examples the actual product being sold is a commodity and what makes it remarkable is something totally peripheral to what you are buying yet the seller can and does command premium pricing because they are selling a remarkable experience 

What can you do on your business that is remarkable? 
answering this questions has a huge impact on your business.
