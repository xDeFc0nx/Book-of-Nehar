Marketing is an uphill battle if you haven't clarified why your business exists
and why people should buy from you rather than your nearest competitor?

You need to develop your unique selling proposition USP
this is where a lot of people get stuck, they say something like "I sell coffee there's nothing unique about that"
really?, then why aren't we all just getting our 1 dollar coffee from 7-Eleven?
Why don't we queue up to spend $4 to $5 to buy our coffee from some hipster that looks like he's in need of an urgent bath?

You regularly pay 400% to 500% for the same commodity, 
think about water for example the most abundant commodities on earth,
when you buy this commodity in bottled form at a store or a venting machine you happly pay 2,000 times to getting it 
from your tap at home,

see how the commodity in both examples hasn't changed? But the circumstances and things around the commodity
have changed or the way they are packaged and delivered has changed,

the entire goal of your USP is to answer this question, 
Why should I buy from you rather than your nearest competitor?

Another test is this, if I remove your company name and logo from your website, would people still know that it's you?
Or could it be another company in your industry 

The common place people go wrong in developing their USP is they say "quality or great service" is their USP
there are two things with that one quality and great service are expectations they are just part of good business practice
not something unique, two people only find out about your quality and great service after they buy,
a good USP is designed to attract prospects before they've made a purchasing decision,

you know you're marking your business as a commodity when prospects start the conversation by asking you about price
positioning yourself as a commodity and hence being shop on price alone is a terrible position to be as a small business
owner to be in.

The solution is to develop a Unique Selling proposition USP something that positions you differently 
so that prospects are forced to make apples to oranges comparison when comparing you with your competitor,
if they can do an apples to apples comparison then it comes down to price and your toast,
there is always someone willing to sell cheaper than you.

Answering these two questions is the path towards marketing success

Why should they buy?

Why should they buy from us?

These are the questions that should have clear and concise answers,
what is the unique advantage you are offering?
