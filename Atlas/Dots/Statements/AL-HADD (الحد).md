* The intent behind the term [[AL-HADD (الحد)]] is that Allah is distinct and separate (_bā’in_) from the creation – and this is a refutation of the Jahmiyyah who propagate the notion of the unity of existence

[[Wahdatul-Wujood]], i.e. that Allah is one with the creation and that He is in every place. [[Abdullah Ibn Al-Mubarak]] (d. 181H) said: **“We know our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, is above the Seven Heavens, over His Throne, separate (bā’in بائن) from the creation with a limit (bi-haddin بحد) – and we do not say as the Jahmiyyah say, that He is here” – and [[Abdullah Ibn Al-Mubarak]] pointed to the earth.”**

[[Imam Ismaeel Ibn Muhammad Ibn Al-Fadl Al-Asbahanee]] (rahimahullāh) said: **“The people of verification and insight have discussed the explanation of ‘Al-Hadd’ (الحد) with various expressions. And what is attained from these expressions is: that Al-Hadd is every thing whose place is separate and distinct from another. So if the intent of the one who says that “there is no limit for Allah”, is that the knowledge of the created beings cannot encompass Him, then he would be correct. And if his intent by this is that Allah’s knowledge cannot encompass Himself, then such a person is astray.”** (Kitāb Ithbāt Al-Hadd of Ad-Dashtee, p. 121) I (Shaikh Ali Nāsir) say: This is the meaning of the saying of the Salaf concerning every matter of “how the Attributes of Allah are” – and that is none knows the “how” except Allah. And upon the Muslim is to affirm the Attributes as they are mentioned in the Book and Sunnah and to have imān in them.

Ad-Dashtee in his book _“Ithbāt al-Hadd lillaahi”_ brought citations from the Salaf in clarification of what they intended by this term (_al-Hadd_), so he said: **“The _madhhab_ of the scholars of the Salaf was that Allah is the Al-Awwal Al-Qadeem (The First, Ever Living without beginning) and He has a _hadd_ not known to other than Him. However it is not for any person to speculate concerning the degree/extent of His _hadd_. Rather it is simply upon the people to believe in that and leave the knowledge of this matter to Allah, the Most High.”**

Ahlus-Sunnah say: Allah in His perfection is above His Throne, He knows and hears from above His Throne – nothing of His creation is hidden to Him; nothing is veiled from Him; His knowledge of the creation is from above the Throne and His penetrating sight encompasses them all. Allah, the Most High, said:

وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا ۗ

“My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge all things.”

(Al-Anām: 80) and He did not say: “By His Essence.”

الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ

“The Most Beneficent ascended over the Throne.”

(Taha: 5)

وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ

“And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves…”

(Al-Anām: 18, 61)

إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ الْكَلِمُ الطَّيِّبُ

“To Him ascend all the goodly words.”

(Fātir: 10)

إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَيَّ

“O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself…”

(Āli Imrān: 55)

تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ

“The angels and the Ruh [Jibreel] ascend to Him…”

(Al-Maārij: 4)

يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ

(An-Nahl: 50)

Thereafter he brings hadeeth narrations with this same meaning, and citations from the Imāms until he mentions this narration of Al-Harawee. He brings this narration from him mentioning the chapter that Al-Harawee himself brings and that is: “Affirming _Al-Hadd_ for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic” for the purpose of clarifying the intent of the Salaf regarding that.
