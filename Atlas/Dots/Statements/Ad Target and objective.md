To start marketing on purpose, we need to look at two vital elements,

1: what is the purpose of your ad? 
2: what does your ad focus on?

Rule of thumb, one ad one objective 
if something in the ad isn't helping you active that objective
then it's detracting from it 

that includes your company name and company logo, 
advertising space is valuable and these things taking up space
often retract from your message rather than enhance it,

rather than trayng to sell directly from your ad, simply invite prospects 
to put their hand up and indicate interest, this lowers the resistance
and helps you build a marketing database,

once your objective is clear, you need to communicate it to your reader

What exactly do you want them to do next?

Do they call your toll-free number to order?

Do they call you or visit your website to request a free sample?

You need a very clear call-to-action
not something wimpy and vague like "don't hesitate to call us!"
you need to be clear on what they should do next and what they will get in return
also give them multiple ways to take that action
