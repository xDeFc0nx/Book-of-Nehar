## Scarcity
Your offer needs to have an element of scarcity a reason why people need to
respond imitatively, people respond much more to fear of loss then the 
prospect of gain.

You need a good reason Why this scarcity exists, you don't want to be in-genuine,
you have limited supply, time, resources, use this to your advantage in your marketing
if you can have a running countdown time or available stock this can further 
turn up the head in the fear of loss emotion.
