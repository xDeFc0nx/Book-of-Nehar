## Target the pain

You've got a splitting headache. You open your medicine cabinet and
start rifling through your museum of half used tablets creams and vitamins,
all only to realize you are totally out of pain revilers medication
so you rush down to the local pharmacy to get the relive you so desperately 
need, 

do you worry about the price?
does it even enter your mind to shop around and see if you can buy
the same product cheaper at another pharmacy, unlikely you are in pain 
and need immediate relive even if the tables were price double or triple
the normal cost you'd probably still buy

the usually methods of shopping get thrown out the window when we are in pain
the exact is true for your costumers and prospects, 
so many times business talk about features and benefits rather then speaking
to the pain the costumer has, how much selling does a pharmacist need to do
to sell a medicine to someone who has a splitting headache, very little,
the same is true whether you sell TV's cars or consulting you have 
costumers and prospects who are in pain they want pain relive not features
and benefits, if you are selling me a TV you can try selling me features 
and benefits by telling me its got 4 HDMI ports or 8k this will mean very
little to most people imagine instead you target my pain point, which is
bringing it back home and spending infuriating number of hours trying to get it 
working properly with all my other devices instead of price discount
and positioning your self as a commodity [[Apples-to-apples comparison]]
why not offer to deliver it to my house mount it on the wall
and ensure the photo quality is top notch and verify it works perfectly
now you are giving me pain relive and price becomes less important then 
if you were selling me a commodity with a list of features and benefits

in the above example even if you were selling the exact same TV's as your
competitor  if you package it in a way that takes away my pain you won
my business its also likely i will become a raving fan and refer others to you
now its [[Apples-to-oranges comparison]] how do you compare this to "Its got 4 HDMI ports and 8k resolution"

selling features and benefits is the best way to turn your prospects into 
shophopers who view your product as a commodity bought solely on price
your job is to turn any comparison to apples-to-oranges comparison

remember people are much more likely to pay for a cure then prevention
targeting existing pain rather then promising future pleasure
will result in much higher conversion much higher costumer satisfaction
and lower price resistance

look for pain points in your industry and become the relive to the pain points.
