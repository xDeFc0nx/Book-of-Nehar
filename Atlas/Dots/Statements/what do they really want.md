It's rarely the thing you are selling it's usually the result of the thing you are selling
the difference may seem subtle, but it's huge for example a person buying a $50 watch then a person buying $50,000 watch 
in the latter they're buying status, luxury and exclusivity, so to get into the mind of the prospect we need to discover what
results they are actually buying, once you understand this you then need to craft your [[Unique Selling Point]] based on 
the results your prospects want to achieve for example if you're a printer you're
in a commodity business you want to get out of the commodity business as quickly as possible
stop selling business cards brochures and printing and start asking open-ended questions such as why are you coming to a printer
what is it that you want to achieve the prospect doesn't want business cards and brochures 

They want what they think business cards and brochures are going to do for their business 
so you can sit down with them and say, what are you trayng to accomplish? let's do a printing audit and evaluate all the things 
you're trying to use printing for by taking them through the process you can charge them to do a printing audit 
then if they end up hiring you to do their printing you can apply consulting fee towards printing this way vou're no longer viewed 
as a printer anymore you're now viewed as a trusted advisor that serving their needs.

If you confuse them, you lose them

understand that your prospect has essentially three options
buy from you 
buy from your competitor
do nothing
