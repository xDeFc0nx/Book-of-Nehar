*"The purpose of business is to create a customer."* - Peter Drucker

This is your central map for understanding the art and science of business. It serves as a strategic overview, connecting the fundamental pillars that turn an idea into a functioning, value-creating enterprise. Use this map to build a holistic understanding of how the different parts of a business work together.

Here are a few foundational concepts to start with:

- **Value Proposition**: At its core, a business must solve a painful problem or fulfill a strong desire for a specific group of people. What value are you creating, and for whom? `[[Value Proposition]]`
- **Business Model**: This is the blueprint for how your business creates, delivers, and captures value. It's the system that makes you money. `[[Business Model Canvas]]`
- **Leverage**: The art of accomplishing more with less. Leverage can come from capital, labor, technology (code), or media. `[[Leverage]]`
