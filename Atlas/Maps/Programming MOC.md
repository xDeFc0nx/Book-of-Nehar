*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."* - Martin Fowler

This is your central map for the craft of software engineering. It's less about collecting code snippets and more about building a deep, first-principles understanding of how to build effective, maintainable, and elegant software. This map guides your thinking about the *art* of programming.

I'll start you with a few foundational pillars:

- **Problem Decomposition**: The skill of breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable pieces. This is the most crucial step before writing a single line of code. `[[Problem Decomposition]]`
- **Abstraction**: The art of hiding complexity. Good abstraction means you can use a component without needing to know how it works internally. This is the foundation of `[[DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)]]`.
- **Data is King**: The choice of data structures often dictates the algorithm and the overall design of the program. Understand the data, and the code will follow. `[[Data Structures]]`
