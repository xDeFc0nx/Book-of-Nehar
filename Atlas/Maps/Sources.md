This is where I keep tabs on some of the sources I have encountered. 
What "sources" should you track? 
How about books and movies?

> [!Book]- ### Books
> ```dataview
> TABLE WITHOUT ID
>  year as "Year",
>  file.link as Book
> 
> WHERE
> 	contains(in,link("Books")) and
> 	!contains(file.name, "Template")
> 
> SORT year asc
> ```

> [!video]- ### Movies
> ```dataview
> TABLE WITHOUT ID
>  year as "Year",
>  file.link as Movie
>  
> FROM -#x/readme
> 
> WHERE
> 	contains(in,link("Movies")) and
> 	!contains(file.name, "Template")
> 
> SORT year asc

I am playing around with a property field called `in`. It allows me a nice way to create a few passive maps for different types of sources into different collections. Here's what I have so far, feel free to make more:

- [[Books]] | [[Games]] | [[Movies]] | [[Papers]] | [[Songs]] | [[Speeches]]

>  file.link as Source

> 	!contains(file.name, "Template")

Not included here, but in my personal vault, I enjoy checking out the comprehensive [[Source MOC]] and perusing my [[Bookshelf ğŸ“š]]. And to honor the old ones, I also keep a [[Commonplace Book]] based on tags.
