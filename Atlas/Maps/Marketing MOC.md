## [[Copywriting MOC]]
In direct response marketing we use copy that is designed to push 
the emotional hot buttons of the target auidence rather then using
the conventioal boring professional sounding copy we use copy that 
is like a car accident no matter how much you dont want to
you cant help but look emotional direct response copywriting uses
attention grabing headlines strong sales copy and compelling calls to action
its as called salesmanship in print many businesses especially thoes who sell
products or serivces to professional or business custmuers feel like this
type of copy is not appropriate for thier market while its true we 
should tailor our approach to this market as we would with any target
market, it would be a major mistake to discount emotional direct response
copywriting wether you are CEO of furtune 500 company or the janitor
we are all big bags of emotion and our buyng decisions are made with
emotion and then justified with logic later
