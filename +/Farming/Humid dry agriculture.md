Humid dry agriculture, often referred to as dryland farming or rainfed agriculture, is a method of cultivation that relies primarily on natural precipitation (rainfall) for water supply to crops. It is practiced in regions with relatively limited and unpredictable rainfall, where the availability of water is a critical factor for agricultural productivity. This approach contrasts with irrigated agriculture, where water is artificially supplied to crops through various methods such as canals, pumps, and sprinklers.
